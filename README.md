# Page Swapper

Page swapper is a chrome extension to easily swap between domains while keeping the same path and url parameters.

The main use case is to swap between multiple environments while keeping the same page. It's super handy for comparing pages while developing.
For example, you can easily swap between:
- `localhost/my-page/4`,
- `www.mywebsite.com/my-page/4`
- `staging.mywebsite.com/my-page/4`.
